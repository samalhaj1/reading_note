# What is Git

**Git is a Version Control System or VCS. VCS is basically software designed to record changes within one or more files over time. It allows us to undo or to cancel all made or pending changes within one or more files. If we're working on a project with many files, VCS enables us to control the whole project. If necessary, this allows us to revert one or more files any of their previous versions or the whole project to a previous version. We can also compare changes to one file between two versions in order to see exactly what was changed in each file, when it was changed and who made the change. We can also see why the change was made.**

# Types of VCS

1. Local Version Control System

2. Centralized Version Control System

3. Distributed Version Control System

## what is Git?

*Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.*

*Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.*

### Branching and Merging

*The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other SCM out there is its branching model.*

*Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds.*

**This means that you can do things like:**

#### Frictionless Context Switching.

*Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in.*

### Role-Based Codelines.

*Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work.*

#### Feature Based Workflow.

*Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.*

#### Disposable Experimentation.

*Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the workâ€”with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime)*
