# Wireframes

## What are Wireframes?

A wireframe is a schematic or blueprint that is useful for helping you, your programmers and designers think and communicate about the structure of the software or website you're building.

## Why use wireframes?

The same screen can be built in a lot of different ways, but only a few of them will get your message across correctly and result in an easy-to-use software or website. Nailing down a good interface structure is possibly the most important part of designing software.

Doing this work now, before any code is written and before the visual design is finalized, will save you lots of time and painful adjustment work later. For more information about why people choose to wireframe.

### *summary*:

1. Wireframes help get your message across
2. Wireframes help you nail down the interface
3. Wireframes result in easy to use software and websites
4. Wireframes save you time and adjustment work later.

In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

## What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process?

_ Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design

_ Sketch > Code

_ Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code

_ Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## The best tools for wireframing:

[UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/): has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.

# HTML

## What is HTML?

1. **HTML** stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
2. **HTML** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
3. **HTML** describes the structure of a Web page
4. **HTML** consists of a series of elements
5. **HTML** elements tell the browser how to display the content
6. **HTML** elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.



## Anatomy of an HTML element
Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.

### The main parts of our element are as follows:

**The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

**The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

**The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

# Semantics


In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## Semantics in JavaScript

In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

## Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

## Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page.
