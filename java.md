# **Introduction to Java Script**

## definition:

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantic, and use.

**JavaScript variables are containers for data values.**

**Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.**

**JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.**

**You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:**

## Object Properties

*The name:values pairs in JavaScript objects are called properties:*

### Accessing Object Properties
*You can access object properties in two ways:*

objectName.propertyName

**or**

objectName["propertyName"]


## Object Methods

#### Objects can also have methods.

#### Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

#### Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.

#### A method is a function stored as a property.

### Accessing Object Methods

*You access an object method with the following syntax:*

objectName.methodName()

**Example**

name = person.fullName();

*If you access a method without the () parentheses, it will return the **function definition**:*


**Example**

name = person.fullName;
