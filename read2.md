# What is Git

**Git is a Version Control System or VCS. VCS is basically software designed to record changes within one or more files over time. It allows us to undo or to cancel all made or pending changes within one or more files. If we're working on a project with many files, VCS enables us to control the whole project. If necessary, this allows us to revert one or more files any of their previous versions or the whole project to a previous version. We can also compare changes to one file between two versions in order to see exactly what was changed in each file, when it was changed and who made the change. We can also see why the change was made.**

# Types of VCS

1. Local Version Control System

2. Centralized Version Control System

3. Distributed Version Control System

## so what is Git?

### Snapshots

*Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.*

### Local Operations

*Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.*

### Tracking Changes

*Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit*

### Loss of Data

*Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.*

### States

*Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.*

### Committed

*Data is securely stored in a local database*

### Modified

*File has been changed but not committed to the database*
